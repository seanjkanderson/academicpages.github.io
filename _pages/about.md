I graduated with a B.S. in energy engineering from U.C. Berkeley. I specialized in controls engineering but also enjoy
heat transfer and fluid mechanics. I'm always trying to learn more whether it's about interior point methods,
a blank spot on the far reaches of a map, or the people around me. My current interests are:
* Stochastic optimization and control
* Portfolio optimization
* Numerical solvers

Growing up...
------
I hail from the small town of Nevada City, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There, I learned to love 
the natural world, understand how humans change the face of the planet, and explore the unknown. 

...still growing up
------
I recently got back from a bikepacking trip in China in June and then living on the road in the western United States 
for a few months. I like to nerd out and play big in the outdoors. I'm back in Berkeley, California, working at a small 
startup, New Sun Road.

------
__Memorable books__:
* The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

What's next?
------
I am planning to attend graduate school in the fall of 2020. I'm passing my time by focusing on topics related to 
control theory, state estimation, and numerical methods for computing.
