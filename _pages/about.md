How do I pass the time?
------
I graduated with a B.S. in energy engineering from U.C. Berkeley. I specialized in controls engineering but also enjoy
heat transfer and fluid mechanics. I'm always trying to learn more whether it's about differential dynamic programming,
a blank spot on the far reaches of a map, or the people around me. My current interests include:
* Stochastic optimization and control
* Quantitative finance
* iLQR and DDP
* Active estimation

Growing up...
------
I hail from the small town of Nevada City, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There, I learned to love 
the natural world, understand how humans change the face of the planet, and explore the unknown. 

...still growing up
------
I finished my B.S. in May 2018. The day after graduation I went on a bikepacking trip in China. When I got back I lived on the road in the western United States 
for a few months. I like to nerd out and play big in the outdoors. Now, I'm back in Berkeley, California, working at a
startup, New Sun Road.
