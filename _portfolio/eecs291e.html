    Abstract:
</b>

<p>In this paper, we attempt to optimally schedule the charging of long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs)
along highway networks, in order to minimize aggregate costs to the overall system consisting of utilities
or electricity providers, station operators and other infrastructure, as well as EV users. Thus, we approach
the problem from the perspective of both customers (EV car owners), as well as charging station operators and
utilities using a hybrid systems based formulation.</p>

<p>In this paper, we propose looking at the scheduling problem for EV charging from the perspective of minimizing aggregate
costs to the system as a whole. This addresses an important null space in the literature since much of the previous
work in this area has focused on optimizing the allocation of charging power with respect to only one of the players
i.e. utilities, charging station operators, or customers.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the past research has also focused on determining optimal locations for charging stations in a given area.
However, in this paper, we take the station locations (i.e. the nodes) as a fixed parameter for a particular city or
urban area’s highway network. Instead, we aim to design a central controller or algorithm that determines the optimal
trajectory that an EV can take given their starting position and desired destination, in a manner that maximizes
benefits to all stakeholders involved.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, a great deal of effort has gone into minimizing losses to utilities and the grid - and utilizing EVs to
provide services like load flattening, voltage and frequency regulation. However, we place more emphasis on the
opportunity costs paid by customers as well, in terms of both time spent and physical degradation of their car
batteries. Following the prescribed route will also help alleviate range anxiety among users, and potentially contribute
towards increased EV penetration.
<p>
Additionally, this work defines a hybrid systems theoretic model and uses finite state machines to describe the
dynamics of electric vehicles on a highway network under two different frameworks. The model is first described
under a framework that is more easily converted into code. The second description allows for more thorough analysis of
the model’s properties.
