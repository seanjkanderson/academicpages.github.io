For the course ME C134/EECS C128, one of the labs we did was levitating a steel bearing with analog control (i.e. no
computers). The goal was to levitate a bearing statically using an op amp, which is by definition, a PID controller.
The respective gains can be tuned, which was the essence of the lab.

<b>
    Summary:
</b>

<p>In this lab, my lab partners, Vineet Nair and Hadi Zhang, aim to design an analog controller (using MATLAB) for the
    magnetic levitation system (linearized model) whose parameters we identified, and then implement this
    physically using circuit elements and hardware. Our design goal is an analog compensator such that the open loop
    systemâ€™s DC gain (the product of compensator gain as well as the plant) is 2 A/m, controller pole/zero ratio is
    roughly 20 and the phase margin is approximately 60 degrees.

    The controller for this lab utilized an op amp for the analog control. In particular the design phase allowed for
    choosing the location of the poles of the PID controller. The poles initially selected/designed for did not work for
    the system. Interestingly, I would later learn about H-infinity loopshaping from Andy Packard and understand the
    lack of robustness in the classical control methods taught in EECS C128.
